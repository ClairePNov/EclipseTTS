	/* prompt: Write a public static method called "toPower" that 
takes in as parameters two integers called size and 
power. The method should return an array of size 
"size" with each array index raised to the value of
 "power." So, for example, if we passed in "size = 4" 
 and "power = 2" to the "toPower," the method should
  return the following result: [0,1,4,9].
